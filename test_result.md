# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(3) Stats grid enhanced with sm:grid-cols-2 for earlier two-column layout on tablets, responsive icon sizes (w-10 h-10 sm:w-12 sm:h-12), and responsive text (text-xs sm:text-sm for labels, text-xl sm:text-2xl for numbers). (4) Quick action buttons changed to flex-col sm:flex-row with w-full sm:w-auto for stacked mobile layout and full-width buttons. (5) Recent items grid enhanced with responsive padding (p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-5), responsive image sizes (w-14 h-14 sm:w-16 sm:h-16), proper flex containers with flex-shrink-0 and min-w-0 for truncation. (6) All spacing, margins, gaps, and text sizes progressively enhanced across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints. (7) Loading state also updated with responsive sizing. All changes maintain existing functionality while providing 200% better mobile experience."

Services filtering by category and location functional. ✅ Database Operations: CRUD operations, sample data initialization, and complex filtering queries performing well. ✅ Image Upload System: Authentication, file validation, thumbnail generation, and error handling all functional. ✅ MTN MoMo Integration: Payment processing, status checking, callback handling, and token management working correctly. ✅ Security & Error Handling: Proper authentication checks, invalid ID handling (404s), malformed parameter validation (422s). Minor Issue: Negative skip parameter causes 500 error instead of 400 validation error - needs input validation improvement. Backend fully supports enhanced FilterSidebar functionality and maintains backward compatibility."
