The previous AI engineer focused on enhancing Habitere, addressing critical bugs and implementing new features. Initial efforts included fixing property posting route protection and improving frontend validation error display. Persistent Domain not found infrastructure issues were noted but beyond code fixes. Core authentication was extensively refactored, resolving a  during login for legacy users, removing Google OAuth, and streamlining registration without email verification. Significant styling updates were applied to the landing, security, and services pages, adopting green as the platform color and adding interactive elements like a service carousel. Finally, a comprehensive subscription and payment system was largely implemented on the backend and partially on the frontend, with routes and basic UI components created. The engineer is currently working on enhancing the Asset Management landing page.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a Cameroonian real estate and home services platform supporting various user roles including Property Seekers, Owners, Agents, Service Providers, and Admins. It uses Email/Google authentication (though Google has been removed), SendGrid for email verification (also removed), and role-based access. Core functionalities include property CRUD, multi-image uploads, a professional services directory with reviews, and an Admin Dashboard. Recent additions include a Homeland Security module for security guards and services, and an Asset Management module for registering, maintaining, and managing property assets, maintenance, expenses, and inventory. The latest major feature request is a comprehensive subscription and payment system with specific annual plans for various user roles and a 5% commission model for hotels. This system requires backend modules for plans, user subscriptions, payments, and commissions, along with frontend pages for pricing, checkout, and a subscription dashboard.

<pending_tasks>
-   Initiate and complete comprehensive frontend testing for the property posting flow (UI/UX, form submissions, image upload, authorization, mobile responsiveness, error scenarios). This was superseded by other fixes and styling requests.
-   Frontend development for the detailed subscription plan pages, payment checkout, and subscription dashboard components needs to be fleshed out beyond just creating placeholder files and routes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with enhancing the Asset Management page () to meet industry standards and reflect both self-service and managed asset management offerings. The engineer has just created a new file, , to contain the redesigned content.

This follows a series of significant updates:
1.  **Authentication Refactor**: Critical bugs in user login (KeyError: 'password' for legacy Google users) were fixed in . Google login and email verification were completely removed from both backend and frontend (, , ). Registration now auto-redirects to the dashboard.
2.  **Platform Styling**: The platform's primary color was changed to green. The desktop landing page () and the security landing page ( -> ) were extensively restyled for a modern, industry-standard look.
3.  **Navigation & Services**: The footer menu in  was restructured, and the  page () was enhanced with an interactive carousel for service categories and a bug related to  was fixed. Navigation links for Pricing and Subscription Dashboard were added to .
4.  **Subscription System**: Backend routes and logic for subscription plans, user subscriptions, payments, and commissions were largely implemented in  and integrated into . Frontend placeholder pages (, , ) and their routes in  were created.
A persistent Domain not found error has been observed in screenshots, indicating an infrastructure or deployment issue that is currently external to code-level fixes.
