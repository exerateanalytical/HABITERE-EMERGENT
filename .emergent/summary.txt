The AI engineer's work focused on enhancing the Habitere platform, moving it from MVP to near production-ready. Initial efforts involved improving mobile responsiveness and overhauling the authentication system to Email/Password and Google OAuth, replacing Emergent Auth, integrating SendGrid, and establishing role selection. Static content pages were created and routed. Subsequently, the engineer systematically implemented core features: creating a global Footer component, adding comprehensive backend admin endpoints and corresponding frontend admin pages (AdminDashboard, AdminUsers, AdminProperties), developing a user reviews and ratings system, and rewriting the messaging and booking functionalities. Throughout, the engineer performed continuous testing (backend using curl, frontend via screenshots and E2E agent). The primary challenge encountered was persistent authentication issues, particularly admin login and Google OAuth redirect mismatches after deployment, traced to incorrect environment variables and Google Cloud Console settings. The latest actions involve guiding the user to correct Google Cloud Console redirect URIs to resolve Google login failures.

- An Admin Dashboard for management.
- Users can contact property owners via call and WhatsApp.
- Static content pages: About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy Policy, Terms, Help Center.

**Implementation so far has delivered:**
- Comprehensive mobile and desktop responsiveness across key pages, including refactored CSS and component logic.
- A robust authentication system with Email/Password, Google OAuth, SendGrid for email verification, and a user role selection flow.
- Enhanced image handling and display of property images.
- Basic property CRUD, with user-listed properties visible on profiles and appropriate edit/delete buttons.
- Call and WhatsApp contact buttons on the property details page.
- Static content pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms, Help Center) have been created and routed, with a global Footer.
- Backend admin features for user and property management, reviews and ratings, and real-time messaging have been implemented. The BookingPage has been rewritten.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical deployment configuration issues reported by the user regarding Google OAuth login and general API calls. The user deployed the platform to  and encountered Access blocked: Habitere’s request is invalid and redirect_uri_mismatch errors for Google login, along with 401 errors for  on the console, indicating frontend API calls were going to an incorrect domain.

The AI engineer identified and attempted to fix:
1.  **Google OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch**: Updated  in  from  to .
2.  **Frontend API Calls**: Updated  in  from  to .
3.  **Cookie Settings**: Re-enabled  and  for session cookies in  for production.
4.  **CORS Configuration**: Verified  was included in  in .

Despite these code changes and service restarts, the user reported the *same* Google login error. The AI engineer then analyzed a screenshot provided by the user of their Google Cloud Console configuration and identified that the Authorized redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console itself were incorrectly configured, pointing to frontend dashboard/profile URLs instead of the backend callback.
