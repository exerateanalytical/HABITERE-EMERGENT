The previous AI engineer made significant progress on the Habitere platform. The initial focus involved enhancing mobile responsiveness across key pages like Dashboard, Properties, Services, and Property Details, resolving critical CSS conflicts in , and adapting carousel components for better mobile display. A major effort was dedicated to overhauling the authentication system, replacing Emergent Auth with Email/Password and Google OAuth, integrating SendGrid for email verification, and establishing a role selection flow. This involved extensive modifications to  and creating new frontend authentication pages and context. Troubleshooting was used to address deployment issues, including CORS configuration, and to fix property listing/edit button visibility on user profiles and the  page. The engineer also added Call and WhatsApp contact options. Currently, the AI is creating static content pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms, Help Center) and integrating their routes.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a Cameroonian real estate and home services platform designed to streamline property transactions and connect users with housing professionals, supporting role-based access for Property Seekers, Owners, Agents, Service Providers, and Admins.

**Core functionalities include:**
- Email and Google authentication, with admin approval for business accounts (Facebook login was explicitly removed).
- Property listings with CRUD operations, multi-image upload, filtering, and verified badges. Properties should appear on user profiles, and edit/delete buttons should be visible to owners.
- A professional services directory with search, reviews, and Hire Now functionality.
- An Admin Dashboard for management.
- Users should be able to contact property owners via call and WhatsApp.
- Creation of static content pages: About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy Policy, Terms, Help Center.

**Implementation so far has delivered:**
- Comprehensive mobile and desktop responsiveness enhancements across Dashboard, Properties, Services, and Property Details pages, including refactored CSS and component logic for fluid layouts and two-column displays on mobile for property/service listings.
- A robust authentication system with Email/Password, Google OAuth, SendGrid for email verification, and a user role selection flow. Emergent Auth has been removed.
- Enhanced image handling (local storage) and correct display of property images.
- Basic property listing, editing, and deletion (CRUD for properties), with visibility of user-listed properties on their profile and appropriate edit/delete buttons.
- Call and WhatsApp contact buttons on the property details page.
- Static content pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms, Help Center) have been created.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   ****: Core FastAPI application. Underwent a major overhaul for the new authentication system (Email/Password, Google OAuth, SendGrid integration, password hashing, role management). Emergent Auth endpoints were removed. User model was updated with email verification and password fields. CORS configuration was fixed to allow specific origins rather than a wildcard when  is true.
-   ****: Added  library.
-   ****: Updated to include , , and  for deployment.
-   ****: Central routing. Updated significantly to integrate new authentication routes (e.g., , , , , , , ). Also added routes for new static pages (, , , , , ).
-   ****: Modified global , , and  classes to be responsive by default using Tailwind's  directive, resolving conflicting styles that affected component responsiveness.
-   ****: Refactored for enhanced mobile responsiveness. Changed grid layout to  on mobile to display properties in two columns.
-   ****: Enhanced for mobile responsiveness, fixed hardcoded owner name, added Edit Property and Delete Property buttons (visible to owner), and implemented Call and WhatsApp contact buttons. Fixed a  import syntax error.
-   ****: Received extensive mobile and desktop responsiveness enhancements, including updates to grid layouts, card padding, and button styling.
-   ****: Updated to link to the new authentication pages (, ) and remove Emergent Auth references. Enhanced mobile menu.
-   ****: Modified  logic and card width calculations to display 2 property cards on mobile.
-   ****: Modified  logic and service card width calculations to display 2 service cards on mobile.
-   ****: Completely rewritten to support the new authentication system, handling user state, tokens, and role information.
-   ** (NEW Directory)**: Contains newly created pages for the authentication flow: , , , , , , . These replaced the old  and  from the root  directory.
-   **New Static Content Pages**: , , , , ,  were created as a part of adding new static routes.

- Comprehensive testing of payment and booking systems, including full MTN Mobile Money integration beyond the sandbox setup.
- Development of a full admin panel (beyond just backend endpoints).
- Implementing real-time messaging and notifications.
- Advanced search filters (price ranges, amenities, full functionality beyond basic UI).
- User reviews and ratings system.
- Frontend automated testing for the new authentication system.
- Content generation for the newly created static pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy Policy, Terms, Help Center).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on fulfilling the user's request to update the about, contact page and all other pages like hlp center, terms and privacy policies ,faq etc. create enough content on them. The engineer successfully created the following new static content pages in :
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

The engineer then began the process of integrating these newly created pages into the application's routing. The last recorded action was editing  to add the routes for these pages, specifically identifying where to insert them within the existing routing structure. The goal is to make these pages accessible via their respective URLs.
