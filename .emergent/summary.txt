The AI engineer's work on Habitere involved multiple phases, starting with stabilizing the core platform, revamping authentication (Email, Google OAuth, SendGrid), and resolving critical deployment issues like CORS. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing the frontend's mobile responsiveness and native app-like interactions on the landing page, incorporating features like , , and sophisticated skeleton loaders. Persistent environmental and caching problems required significant debugging and troubleshooting agent calls. Button alignment and routing were recurring UI issues. Crucial bug fixes addressed a missing backend profile update endpoint and authentication flow errors caused by an incorrect backend URL in the frontend. An external caching issue was identified as the root cause for properties not displaying correctly. Currently, the project is undergoing a full refactoring to a Feature-Module Architecture, with initial backend module structuring and authentication route extraction completed.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a Cameroonian real estate and home services platform supporting role-based access (Property Seekers, Owners, Agents, Service Providers, Admins). It offers Email and Google authentication (excluding Facebook) with SendGrid email verification and role selection, property CRUD operations with verified badges and multi-image uploads, a professional services directory with reviews, an Admin Dashboard, and direct contact options (call/WhatsApp) for owners. Static pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms, Help Center) are also required.

So far, the platform has achieved comprehensive mobile/desktop responsiveness, a robust Email/Password/Google OAuth system, and enhanced image handling. Basic property CRUD with owner-specific edit/delete is present, alongside call/WhatsApp contact. Static content pages with a global Footer are implemented. Backend admin features for user/property management, reviews/ratings, and rewritten messaging/booking systems are in place. The mobile landing page has undergone a comprehensive redesign for a native feel, and property seekers are redirected to the properties page post-login/registration. The current effort is focused on refactoring the codebase for better organization and maintainability.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   ****: Core FastAPI app. It was modified to add a profile update endpoint, include a property auto-cleanup function, and a manual admin cleanup endpoint. CORS configuration was a recurring challenge. It is currently being refactored, with authentication routes being extracted into separate modules.
-   ** (NEW)**: Centralizes backend configuration settings.
-   ** (NEW)**: Manages MongoDB connection and operations for the backend.
-   ** (NEW)**: The first module extracted from  containing authentication-related API routes, with extensive comments for clarity.
-   ****: Enhanced with / directives and PWA  link for performance and PWA integration.
-   ** (NEW)**: PWA manifest file, enabling web app features like Add to Home Screen.
-   ** (NEW)**: Implemented for caching and PWA service worker functionality, though temporarily deactivated during debugging.
-   ****: Registers the new service worker for client-side caching.
-   ****: Manages central routing. Modified to implement  for role-based access control to  paths, ensuring only authenticated admin users can access them, replacing a less specific . Also conditionally renders mobile/desktop footers.
-   ****: Updated to include , , and shimmer animations for UI enhancements.
-   ****: A newly created component for advanced touch interactions. It underwent multiple iterations to fix icon and text alignment, ensuring correct positioning, vertical centering, and spacing within buttons using  utilities.
-   ****: Provides utilities for lazy loading images and sections to improve performance.
-   ** (NEW)**: A reusable component to display loading states, replacing basic  blocks in , , , and  pages.
-   ****: Updated to support a  field during registration. Enhanced with debugging logs and logic to reload user data post-login for accurate session state.
-   ****: Heavily optimized for mobile responsiveness. Integrated ,  for all major CTAs (hero, search, quick filters, explore services), and  for carousels. The search form was converted to a controlled component with enhanced input attributes. Testimonial section was refined with swipe indicators and .
-   ****: Optimized by integrating  for key actions and  for improved loading states.
-   ****: Optimized similar to , using  and .
-   ****: Essential for environment configuration. Fixed from an incorrect preview URL to  to resolve critical CORS and authentication issues.
-   ** (NEW)**: A comprehensive guide created to facilitate future development and maintenance.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the Full Feature-Module Architecture refactoring for the backend, extracting all remaining routes from .
-   Implement the frontend refactoring to align with the feature-module structure.
-   Address the persistent external caching issue that prevents code changes from reflecting in the production environment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a **Full Feature-Module Refactoring** of the Habitere platform, explicitly requested by the user for better developer handoff and extensive commenting. This process began with **Phase 1: Backend - Create Module Structure**. During this phase, essential backend directories were created, including  and . Core configuration and database modules,  and , were also established. Additionally, a new  and a comprehensive  were created for documentation.

Following this, the AI transitioned into **Phase 2: Backend Route Extraction**. The initial step involved analyzing the monolithic  to identify routes for extraction. The AI then successfully extracted the critical authentication routes into a new, dedicated module: . This newly created file contains authentication-related API endpoints, complete with extensive commenting to explain their functionality and integration, as per the user's explicit request for comprehensive documentation during refactoring.
