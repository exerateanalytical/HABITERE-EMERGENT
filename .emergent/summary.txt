<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the Habitere platform from an MVP state to a more feature-rich application. Key development phases included initial setup of carousels and search filters, followed by a major focus on mobile responsiveness and design enhancements across the Landing, Properties, and Services pages. Image upload functionality was integrated into the backend with local storage, and the MTN Mobile Money sandbox integration was initiated. A significant effort was dedicated to comprehensive SEO implementation, including meta tags, keywords, and sitemap generation, which involved resolving a compilation error. Most recently, the authentication flow was refined with dedicated Login and Register pages, enhancing both UI and user experience. The AI engineer has consistently addressed user requests, iteratively building and refining features, and maintaining a systematic approach to development and testing throughout the trajectory.
