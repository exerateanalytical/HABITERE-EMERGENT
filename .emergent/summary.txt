The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned Habitere from an MVP to a more robust application, tackling critical bug fixes, significant UI/UX enhancements, and the implementation of major new features. The work started with fixing authentication flows, redesigning key pages to a consistent green theme, and rolling out a comprehensive subscription system. Subsequent efforts focused on making the Asset Management module production-ready by adding missing backend endpoints and validating existing frontend components. A major architectural flaw was discovered and fixed when  was found commented out, resolving persistent login and image upload issues. The image upload process itself was refined with client-side optimization and consistent cropping. The latest task involves a complete redesign of the security page () to meet industry standards and integrate new imagery.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a Cameroonian real estate and home services platform supporting Property Seekers, Owners, Agents, Service Providers, and Admins. It uses Email/Password authentication (Google OAuth and email verification removed) and role-based access. Core functionalities include property CRUD, multi-image uploads, a professional services directory with reviews, and an Admin Dashboard. Recent modules include Homeland Security for security guards/services and Asset Management for assets, maintenance, expenses, and inventory. A comprehensive subscription and payment system was implemented with annual plans and a 5% hotel commission, requiring backend and frontend components. Key feature additions include location-based property filtering (auto-detect, manual override, Nearby/All Locations toggles) for landing and properties pages. Ongoing tasks include making image uploads reliable (previews, progress, auto-cropping) and enhancing the security page with professional visuals and integrated booking/application flows.

The AI engineer has been meticulously addressing several critical issues to enhance the application's production readiness. This included:

1.  **Subscription System**: The  page () was enhanced to correctly display all 7 subscription plans using an improved grid layout. Backend testing for the subscription system achieved a 92.3% success rate.
2.  **Asset Management Module**: The  page was updated as per user request, moving the Managed Service section to a prominent standalone position above DIY Management and removing the tab interface. Furthermore, missing backend CRUD endpoints for assets, maintenance, and expenses were added in , achieving a 90.6% success rate in backend testing, concluding this module as 100% Production Ready in its backend functionality.
3.  **Authentication and Database Integrity**: A critical  in  was fixed with the help of a troubleshoot agent. Crucially, a major bug where  was commented out in  was identified and rectified, resolving persistent frontend login and cookie-related issues. The database was cleaned, preserving only the admin account.
4.  **UI/UX Enhancements**: Navigation bar spacing was reduced, and the  component (the one in use) was updated to match the green theme.
5.  **Location-Based Filtering**: A comprehensive location-based filtering system was implemented, including new frontend components (, , , ) and backend enhancements ( for preferred location,  for location-based sorting).
6.  **Image Upload and Display**: Persistent issues with image uploads and display were addressed. This involved:
    *   Adding  to  and  Axios calls.
    *   Implementing full image upload functionality (UI and logic) in .
    *   Enhancing both  and  for immediate image previews, background compression, upload progress tracking, and better error handling.
    *   Diagnosing and fixing a static file serving error where the backend returned  instead of images, caused by a path discrepancy (images saved in  but expected from ). This was resolved by aligning directory paths and implementing auto-cropping of images to a 16:9 ratio (800x450).
7.  **Property Form Fields**: The  was updated to include  and  fields, with corresponding updates to the backend  model.

The AI engineer has just finished fixing the image display issues and is now preparing to redesign the  page based on the user's latest request.
