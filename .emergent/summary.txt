The AI engineer successfully initiated the Habitere platform, a full-stack real estate application using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. Initial tasks included gathering integration details for payments (MTN MoMo), Google login, and sourcing relevant images. The core application structure was then laid out, encompassing basic authentication (signup, login, email verification, password reset) and initial React pages for properties, services, and a landing page. After fixing a minor CSS bug and verifying the initial UI, the user requested an enhancement for a professional services directory with a social-media-style carousel. The AI adeptly navigated a tech stack mismatch in the user's prompt, confirmed the existing FastAPI/React stack, and implemented the services carousel across multiple frontend pages. Following this, comprehensive testing was initiated, revealing minor issues like a lack of sample properties, which was addressed. The latest work involves enhancing search filters and a featured properties carousel. The AI is systematically building out core user journeys and has planned in detail for robust image handling and full property/service flows. The trajectory shows a systematic, iterative development process, with clear communication and adherence to the specified technology stack.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a real estate and home services platform for Cameroon, aiming to simplify property transactions and connect housing professionals. Users select roles (Property Seeker, Owner, Agent, various Service Providers, Admin). Core features include email/Google login with role selection and admin approval for business accounts, property listings (add/edit, multiple image upload, filtering, verified badge), a professional services directory (search, reviews, Hire Now functionality), and an Admin Dashboard. The current build has foundational authentication, initial React pages (Landing, Login, Register, Services, Property Listing, Property Details, Booking, User Profile, Chat), and a professional services carousel integrated across relevant pages (Landing, Property, Services, Dashboard). Advanced search filters and a featured properties carousel have also been added recently.

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


- ****: The main FastAPI application. This file has been extensively rewritten to include initial API endpoints for authentication (signup, login, email verification, password reset skeletons), initial CRUD for properties and services, and now includes sample data initialization for both properties and services to populate the database for testing and demonstration.
- ****: The main React component, responsible for setting up routing (using ) and integrating core components like the  and  (though not explicitly shown in trajectory, implied by structure). It has been updated to include newly created pages and components.
- ****: Global CSS file, primarily using Tailwind CSS. A fix was applied to resolve a  compilation error.
- ****: A new React context created for managing authentication state and actions across the frontend.
- ****: Contains various React pages.
    - : The application homepage, now enhanced with  and  carousel components.
    - , : Authentication forms, interacting with the backend.
    - : Displays a directory of professional services, now includes  and  components.
    - : Displays property listings, now includes ,  and .
    - : Displays details of a specific property, now integrates the .
    - : User dashboard, now includes  and .
    - , , : Other core pages implemented.
- ****: A new React component created to display professional services in a horizontally sliding, auto-scrolling carousel, styled like social media suggestions.
- ****: A new React component to represent an individual professional service within the carousel or directory.
- ****: A new React component to display properties in a carousel, similar to .
- ****: A new React component to provide filtering and search input for property and service listings.
- ****: Updated to include  and other necessary Python packages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of systematically enhancing the Habitere platform. Specifically, it had just integrated new  carousel and  components into various frontend pages such as the , , , and . It also ensured that sample property data was initialized in the backend for these new components to display. The last action taken was restarting the frontend service to apply these newly introduced components and their styling, preparing for their visual verification and testing.
