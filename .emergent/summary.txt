The AI engineer successfully refactored the Habitere backend from a monolithic  to a modular architecture with 12 distinct route files, meticulously cleaning up duplicate code and ensuring 100% endpoint documentation. Post-refactoring, the system achieved 83% backend test success. Subsequently, a Homeland Security module was implemented, adding new roles, backend routes, and frontend pages, achieving an MVP state (60-70% complete). The latest task involves building a comprehensive Asset Management module, with initial steps including adding roles, extending file upload, creating backend routes, and starting frontend page development. The process involved iterative code cleanup, rigorous testing, and phased feature implementation. The AI continuously sought user clarification and prioritized tasks.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a Cameroonian real estate and home services platform supporting various roles: Property Seekers, Owners, Agents, Service Providers, and Admins. It uses Email/Google authentication, SendGrid for email verification, and requires role selection. Core features include property CRUD with verified badges and multi-image uploads, a professional services directory with reviews, an Admin Dashboard, and direct contact options. Static pages are also essential. The application currently features mobile/desktop responsiveness, robust authentication, enhanced image handling, basic property CRUD, and implemented static pages. Admin features for user/property management, reviews/ratings, and rewritten messaging/booking systems are in place.

Recent feature additions include a Homeland Security by Habitere module, a marketplace for security guards and services (CCTV, remote monitoring, etc.), a booking system, guard recruitment, user profiles, payment/contracts (manual payments, digital contracts), an Admin Dashboard for security, and various notifications. This module aims to allow property security requests directly from property pages, GPS tracking, and a panic button.

The latest requirement is for an Asset Management module, a comprehensive system for owners, estate managers, and technicians to register, maintain, and manage property assets and equipment. This includes collections for assets, maintenance tasks, expenses, and inventory with associated roles, workflows, automations, and UI for dashboards, forms, and reports, including mobile layouts. It integrates with existing properties, extends file uploads for documents, adds new roles (, ), and enhances the automation engine.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (UUIDs), bcrypt, SendGrid, HTTPBearer (for authentication).
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router.
-   **Authentication**: JWT, Email/Password, Google OAuth, Email Verification, Role-based access control (AdminRoute, , , , , ).
-   **Architecture**: Feature-Module Architecture (FastAPI routes).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes, Supervisorctl, CORS, Environment Variables.
-   **UI/UX**: Mobile-first design, responsive layouts.
-   **File Management**: Extended image upload endpoint to handle various document types.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, organized into a modular structure.



-   ****: Refactored to 391 lines, now acts as a clean entry point, handling application setup, middleware, and registering all modular API routes. It no longer contains API route definitions or duplicate helper functions. New user roles for Homeland Security and Asset Management (, , , , ) have been added to . The  variable was renamed to  to avoid conflicts.
-   ****: This directory now contains 13 dedicated modules for API routes.
    -   ****: NEW module with 14 endpoints for Homeland Security (stats, service marketplace CRUD, guard applications, bookings, GPS, panic button). Includes notification integrations.
    -   ****: NEW module for Asset Management endpoints (currently being developed).
    -   ****: Modified to extend file upload functionality for various document types beyond just images.
    -   ****: Updated to include  and  modules.
-   ****: NEW utility for handling email and in-app notifications, integrated into  endpoints.
-   ****: Updated to include new routes for Homeland Security and Asset Management pages, including protected routes.
-   ****: Modified to add a navigation link for the Homeland Security module.
-   ****: Many new pages created:
    -   : The main landing page for the security module, visually enhanced to match user-provided image.
    -   : Displays a marketplace of security services.
    -   : Form for individuals to apply as security guards (now requires authentication).
    -   : Detail page for specific security services.
    -   : Page to view individual security guard profiles.
    -   : Page for browsing available security guards.
    -   : Page to manage security-related bookings.
    -   : Dashboard for security service providers.
    -   : Admin dashboard for managing security-related aspects.
    -   : Initial page for the Asset Management module.
-   ****: Modified to include a Hire Security button, linking property pages to the Homeland Security module.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing the Asset Management module, which is the second major feature addition after Homeland Security. The work progressed through several foundational steps:

1.  **Adding New User Roles**: The  list in  was updated to include  and  to support the new module's access control requirements.
2.  **Extending File Upload**: The existing image upload endpoint in  was modified to handle a wider array of document types (PDF, DOC, XLS), crucial for asset and maintenance documentation.
3.  **Creating Backend Routes Module**: A new file, , was created to house all API endpoints for asset management.
4.  **Registering Asset Module**: The  module was imported and registered in  and included in  so that its endpoints are accessible through the FastAPI application.
5.  **Backend Restart and Verification**: The backend was restarted to apply the changes, and a health check confirmed it was running without issues, indicating the new roles and module registration were successful at a basic level.
6.  **Beginning Frontend Development**: The initial frontend development for the Asset Management module has started, with the creation of the  file. The next immediate step is to create additional frontend pages.

The current state is that the backend foundation for Asset Management is laid, including new roles and a dedicated route module, with the file upload system enhanced. The initial dashboard page for the frontend has been created, and the agent is poised to continue building the remaining UI components for this module.
