The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has involved a significant push to stabilize and enhance the Habitere platform. Initial efforts focused on overhauling the authentication system, resolving critical deployment-related configuration issues (Google OAuth, SendGrid, environment variables, CORS), and improving core user flows like registration and login redirects. After addressing deployment and backend authentication stability, the focus shifted to frontend UI/UX, specifically mobile responsiveness and native app-like interactions for the landing page. The engineer systematically analyzed and implemented mobile-first design principles, though some advanced features and performance optimizations are still pending. A recurring challenge was persistent environmental and configuration issues (CORS, backend URLs) that required thorough debugging, including calling the troubleshoot agent. The work concluded with an analysis of remaining mobile UI features to be implemented.

<product_requirements>
Habitere is a Cameroonian real estate and home services platform supporting role-based access for Property Seekers, Owners, Agents, Service Providers, and Admins. Its core functionalities include Email and Google authentication (excluding Facebook), property CRUD operations with verified badges and multi-image uploads, a professional services directory with reviews, an Admin Dashboard, and contact options (call/WhatsApp) for owners. Static pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms, Help Center) are also required.

So far, the platform has achieved comprehensive mobile/desktop responsiveness, a robust Email/Password/Google OAuth system with SendGrid email verification and role selection. Image handling and display are enhanced. Basic property CRUD with owner-specific edit/delete buttons is present, alongside call/WhatsApp contact. Static content pages with a global Footer are implemented. Backend admin features for user/property management, reviews/ratings, and rewritten messaging/booking systems are in place. The mobile landing page has undergone an initial comprehensive redesign for native feel. Property seekers are now redirected to the properties page post-login/registration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was systematically implementing the remaining features to achieve 100% production-ready status for the mobile landing page. This involved:

1.  **Phase 1: Footer & Navigation**
    *   Created  for accordion-based footer on mobile.
    *   Created  for a scroll-to-top Floating Action Button.
    *   Updated  to conditionally render the new  and integrate .
    *   Restarted the frontend successfully.

2.  **Phase 2: Advanced Touch Interactions**
    *   Created  to implement ripple effects on buttons.
    *   Added ripple animation CSS to .

3.  **Phase 3: Lazy Loading & Performance**
    *   Created  for image optimization and lazy loading.

4.  **Phase 4: Sticky Search with Filter Modal**
    *   Created  for the advanced search functionality.
    *   Added slide-up animation CSS to .
    *   Integrated these new components (, , ) into  by adding the necessary imports.
    *   Attempted to add  to the return statement of  and update buttons to use .
    *   Encountered a  error during the integration of  to hero buttons on the Landing Page.
    *   Recovered by restarting the frontend and then continued with applying  to the remaining CTAs.

The immediate next task is to continue applying  to the search button within the Landing Page.
